# Welome to Ez3D Rocketry!

## Want to get started in 3d printing models rockets? Ez3D Rocketry is the place to get you started. 

Ez3D Rocketry developed a family of launch vechiles with FreeCAD, .stl, OpenRocket, and RockSIM files. 

Since 3D printing a tall thin structures can be a challenging, Ez3D designs primarly used printed fin cans and nose cones
while incorporating commercial cardboard body tubes as airframes. 

All designs have been test flown with hints and advice included in the documentaiton. 

Another primary design objective is to build the model without glue to enable quick assembly. 

Six designs are available for a wide range of motor options

1. Ez3D Mini Lite
   - Uses 13mm Estes mini motors and a BT-20 airframe
   - PROS: Flies OK on 1/2 motors (~150+ ft)
   - CONS: Small body tube can make loading recovery gear difficult.
     
2. Ez3D Lite
   - Uses 13mm Estes mini motors and a BT-50 airframe
   - PROS: Best flight use full mini A motor (~250 ft)
   -  Larger Body tube enables easier prep
  
3.  Ez3D
    - Uses 18mm standard motor size and a BT-50 airframe
    - PROS: Performs well with full range of A - C motors
    - Larger Body tube enables easier prep<br />
      NOTE: Needs additional launch lug on body tube to reduce rod whip<br />
      Best recovery with a parachute since a little heavy for streamer


4. Ez3D Max
   - Uses 24mm C11 and D12 motors and a BT-????? airframe<br />
  CONS: no tape? <br />
      NOTE: Uses rail buttons ????????<br />

5. Ez3D Max+
   - Uses 24mm E12 motor and a BT-60 airframe<br />
    CONS: no tape? <br />
      NOTE: Uses rail buttons ????????<br />
      
6. Ez3D Super Max
   - Uses 29mm E16 and F15 motors and a BT-70 airframe<br />
    CONS: no tape? <br />
      NOTE: Uses rail buttons ????????<br />
