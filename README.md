Welcome to Ez3D Rocketry!

## Want to get started using 3D printing with models rockets? <br />

Ez3D Rockets has a series of designs which operate with 1/2A (13mm) to 29mm motors with:
- Low parts count
- Easy assembly (i.e. no glue required)
- Reliable operation

In addition, the FreeCAD, .STL, and simulation files are available to encourage your own experimentation. 

Since 3D printing a tall thin structures can be a challenging, Ez3D designs use printed fin cans and nose cones
while incorporating commercial cardboard body tubes as airframes. 

Six designs are available:

1. Ez3D Mini Lite
   - Uses 13mm Estes mini motors and a BT-20 airframe
   - PRO: Flies OK on 1/2A motors (~150+ ft)
   - CON: Small body tube can make loading recovery gear difficult.
     
2. Ez3D Lite
   - Uses 13mm Estes mini motors and a BT-50 airframe
   - PRO: Best flight use full mini A motor (~250 ft)
   - PRO: Larger Body tube enables easier prep
   - CON: Not the best to fly if you only have a bunch of leftover 1/2A3-4T motors from the demo pack
  
  
3.  Ez3D
    - Uses 18mm standard motor size and a BT-50 airframe
    - PRO: Performs well with full range of A - C motors
    - PRO: Larger Body tube enables easier prep<br />
    - CON/NOTE: Needs additional launch lug on body tube to reduce rod whip<br />
      Best recovery with a parachute since a little heavy for streamer


4. Ez3D Max
   - Sized for 24mm C11 and D12 motors and a BT-55 airframe<br />

5. Ez3D Max+
   - Sized for 24mm E12 motor and a BT-60 airframe<br />
      
6. Ez3D Super Max
   - Sized for 29mm E16 and F15 motors and a BT-70 airframe<br />

### A summary of approximate altitudes is show in the graph below.
