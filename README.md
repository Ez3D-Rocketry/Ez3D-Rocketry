# Welome to Ez3D Rocketry!

## Want to get started in 3D printing enabled models rockets? <br />

Ez3D Rockets was started to develop models with:
- Low parts count
- Easy assembly (i.e. no glue required)
- Reliable operation

The results is a family of launch vechiles which operate with 1/2 to F motors and altitiudes over 1000 ft. <br/>
In addition, all the FreeCAD, .stl, OpenRocket, and RockSIM files are available to encourage your own experimention. 

Since 3D printing a tall thin structures can be a challenging, Ez3D designs primarly use printed fin cans and nose cones
while incorporating commercial cardboard body tubes as airframes. 

All designs have been test flown with tips and advice included in the documentaiton. 



Six designs are available for a wide range of motor options:

1. Ez3D Mini Lite
   - Uses 13mm Estes mini motors and a BT-20 airframe
   - PRO: Flies OK on 1/2 motors (~150+ ft)
   - CON: Small body tube can make loading recovery gear difficult.
     
2. Ez3D Lite
   - Uses 13mm Estes mini motors and a BT-50 airframe
   - PRO: Best flight use full mini A motor (~250 ft)
   - PRO: Larger Body tube enables easier prep
   - CON: Not the best to fly if you only have a bunch of leftover 1/2A3-4T motors from the demo pack
  
  
3.  Ez3D
    - Uses 18mm standard motor size and a BT-50 airframe
    - PRO: Performs well with full range of A - C motors
    - PRO: Larger Body tube enables easier prep<br />
    - CON/NOTE: Needs additional launch lug on body tube to reduce rod whip<br />
      Best recovery with a parachute since a little heavy for streamer


4. Ez3D Max
   - Uses 24mm C11 and D12 motors and a BT-55 airframe<br />
  CONS: no tape? <br />
      NOTE: Uses rail buttons ????????<br />

5. Ez3D Max+
   - Uses 24mm E12 motor and a BT-60 airframe<br />
    CONS: no tape? <br />
      NOTE: Uses rail buttons ????????<br />
      
6. Ez3D Super Max
   - Uses 29mm E16 and F15 motors and a BT-70 airframe<br />
    CONS: no tape? <br />
      NOTE: Uses rail buttons ????????<br />
