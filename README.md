Want to get started in 3d printing models rockets? Ez3D Rocketry hosts a variety of 3D rocket files to get you started. 
Ez3D rocketry developed a family of launch vechiles with correstoinding .stl, FreeCAD, OpenRocket, and RockSIM files. 

Since 3D printing a tall thin structures can be a challenging, Ez3D designs primarly used printed fin cans and nose cones
while incorporating commercial cardboard body tubes as airframes. 

All designs have been test flown with hints and advice included in the documentaiton. 

Another primary design objective is to build the model without glue to enable quick assembly.
